#  Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease | R
The project aims to identify the specific demographic and physiological indicators that are associated with the outcome of mortality
from cardiovascular disease and what is the strength of those associations among a globally representative sample taken between 1985
and 1993.

The dataset corresponds to the data collected within the scope of Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in 
Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) study.

I am personally responsible for approx. 83% of the code and 90% of the summary conclusions of the report.

Total number of project team members: 5

The programming language used is R.
